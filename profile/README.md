#### White-label WebRTC SDK to embed voice and video in any app. Compatible with any UCaaS or cloud PBX that supports the SIP protocol.

**WebTrit** is open-source and production-ready, built for developers and telecom teams who need more flexibility than closed, vendor-controlled solutions allow.

You get full source access and control: customize the UI, control the call logic, and integrate with any backend. Your infrastructure, your rules.

#### Built for
- Developers who need deep customization  
- Telecom operators tired of vendor lock-in  
- Teams replacing limited or overpriced tools

#### Why it matters
Communication tools should be open, flexible, and yours to shape.
