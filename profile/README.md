# WebTrit

WebTrit solves the "softphone problem" for developers and telecom operators suffering from the constraints of proprietary softphone vendors. We think that's wrong.

WebTrit gives you a complete, production-ready softphone with full source access. Modify the UI, change the call flows, integrate with any backend. Your infrastructure, your rules.

**Built for:** Developers who need real flexibility and customization, telecom operators tired of vendor limitations, teams replacing proprietary solutions  

**Why it matters:** Communication tools should be open, period.
